THANKS

Inspiration
-----------

First time I used a web radio player, it was on Mac OS, long time ago.
I can't remember the name anymore.

Later on, I used RadioTray on GNU/Linux. However the package provided by Debian
at the time didn't work great, so I went for the upstream version. It was still
buggy, so I digged in the code and submitted a few patches.

Realizing that the project was abandoned, I decided to write another radio player.
Since I wasn't convinced by RadioTray codebase, I started from scratch.



Coding
------

As the codebase of Goodvibes matured, it became more and more object-oriented,
and in the end relied entirely on GObject for a clean object-oriented design.

Learning GObject was a bit tough, and I must thank the following projects for
teaching me everything I know now about GObject.

 - [GLib/GObject](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/)
 - [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)
 - [GTK+](https://www.gtk.org/)

I also had to peek into the code of some other music players here and there.

 - [Rhythmbox](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox)
 - [Parole](http://docs.xfce.org/apps/parole/start)
 - [Quodlibet](https://quodlibet.readthedocs.io/)
 - [RadioTray](http://radiotray.sourceforge.net/)

As for my little Makefile skills, I owe it all to Buildroot.

People
------

Last but not least, I'd like to thank some fellow developers who taught me a
lot when we worked together. Mgo, Jcdr, thanks a bunch !
